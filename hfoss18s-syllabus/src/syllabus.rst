 ## Text Books

There are a number of textbooks we’ll be referencing throughout the
semester. They will be added to `the resources page </oer>`__ or in the
`library <https://github.com/ritjoe/hfoss-library>`__ for your use.

Purchase of a textbook is not required.


----

 ## What You’ll Do

This course will introduce students to the Free and Open Source Software
(FOSS) and Open Content movements, to the open source development
process, and to the open questions of the efficacy of technology in the
classroom.

Students will learn FOSS process and Tools with class projects that
support the `SugarLabs <https://www.sugarlabs.org>`__ community (or
other humanitarian projects) by creating content and software for free
distribution to students and teachers around the world. The SugarLabs
project is driven by a world-wide community–one of which successful
students in HFOSS will become a part.


----

 ## The spirit of the course

While still a course where you will receive a letter grade, the spirit
of the course is intended to be both open and fun.

An open course – students will have access to the ‘document source’ for
the syllabus. As a student of the class you have a right to `fork the
upstream repository <http://github.com/ritjoe/hfoss>`__ for this
syllabus and other course content (library, wiki), make modifications,
and submit patches for review. Barring a troll festival, this can create
a fun, dynamic environment in which the course curriculum can develop by
the very same mechanism being taught during the semester
(community-driven).


----

 ## Licensing

All code developed by students in the course must be licensed (by the
student) under any one of the `licenses approved by the Open Source
Initiative <http://www.opensource.org/licenses/category>`__

Code that you write is **your** code, with which you can do what you
will; true. However, if you’re unwilling to license code you write for
an Free/Open Source course with a Free/Open Source license, you may be
in the wrong course.

Similarly, the essence of this course entails your doing significant
collaborative work in public, the results of which will remain public.
If you do not wish to make your work public in this way, please contact
the instructor during the first week of class to make other
arrangements.

Please see this living `schedule <schedule.org>`__ which should be
updated throughout the semester.

Attendance
----------


Attendance is mandatory. Unexecused absences accrue a loss of points & a
penalty of 5% off the total grade.

See the `attendance page <attendance.md>`__ for details.

Grading
-------


Please see `grading policies <grading/grading-policies.md>`__ and this
`example table of full-semester grades <grading/grading-table.md>`__

Blog Updates
------------


Students are *required* to keep a blog to which they post updates about
their investigations, progress, success, and pitfalls. This blog can be
hosted anywhere, but must be added to the course `participant
page </checkblogs>`__ (there are instructions on how to do this in
`*Homework - First Flight* </hw/firstflight>`__). All blog posts are
syndicated to the blog aggregator `HFOSS
Planet <https://people.rit.edu/djaigm/planet/hfoss/>`__.

    You must make at least one blog post per week to receive full
    credit. This is in addition to any assignments that are posted to
    your blog for that week. You must participate regularly in the
    course’s IRC channel: asking and answering questions. Contributions
    to the course curriculum, syllabus, and rubric are factored in here
    as well.

Blogging is good for you and good for the `FLOSS community at
large <http://xkcd.com/979/>`__.

Team Projects
-------------


There are two team projects in the course: A community architecture
project and a final project.

Lightning Talks - Extra Credit
------------------------------


Every Friday for the first portion of class, any student has the
opportunity to give a ``lightning talk`` on a topic of their chosing.
Your lightning talk must be less than 5 minutes in length and must be at
least remotely related to the course material.

All students will do at least one lightning talk. You will receive +10
extra credit points towards your final grade for every subsequent
lightning talk you give. Only the first **2** lightning talks offered
will be allowed during a given class. Talks will be chosen from among
those offered by students on a ``FIFO`` basis.

Bug Fix - Extra Credit
----------------------


You can earn extra credit by successfully fixing a bug in a FOSS
project.

You will receive +10 extra credit points towards your final grade for
every pull request accepted by an independently-maintained project
against a pre-existing bug (eg, fixing new bugs you found, or even
generated don't count!).

Send an `email to the instructor <email:deejoe@mail.rit.edu>`__ with
sufficient detail to confirm your bug fix was accepted.

Accomodations
-------------


RIT is committed to providing reasonable accommodations to students with
disabilities. If you would like to request accommodations such as
special seating or testing modifications due to a disability, please
contact the Disability Services Office. It is located in the Student
Alumni Union, Room 1150; the Web site is www.rit.edu/dso. After you
receive accommodation approval, it is imperative that you see me during
office hours so that we can work out whatever arrangement is necessary.
