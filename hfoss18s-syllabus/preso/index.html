(FOSS) and Open Content movements, to the open source development
process, and to the open questions of the efficacy of technology in the
classroom.</p><p>Students will learn FOSS process and Tools with class projects that
support the <a href="https://www.sugarlabs.org">SugarLabs</a> community (or
other humanitarian projects) by creating content and software for free
distribution to students and teachers around the world. The SugarLabs
project is driven by a world-wide community&#x2013;one of which successful
students in HFOSS will become a part.</p></div><div class="step step-level-1" step="3" data-rotate-x="0" data-rotate-y="0" data-rotate-z="0" data-scale="1" data-x="4800" data-y="0" data-z="0"><blockquote><p>## The spirit of the course</p></blockquote><p>While still a course where you will receive a letter grade, the spirit
of the course is intended to be both open and fun.</p><p>An open course &#x2013; students will have access to the &#x2018;document source&#x2019; for
the syllabus. As a student of the class you have a right to <a href="http://github.com/ritjoe/hfoss">fork the
upstream repository</a> for this
syllabus and other course content (library, wiki), make modifications,
and submit patches for review. Barring a troll festival, this can create
a fun, dynamic environment in which the course curriculum can develop by
the very same mechanism being taught during the semester
(community-driven).</p></div><div class="step step-level-1" step="4" data-rotate-x="0" data-rotate-y="0" data-rotate-z="0" data-scale="1" data-x="6400" data-y="0" data-z="0"><blockquote><p>## Licensing</p></blockquote><p>All code developed by students in the course must be licensed (by the
student) under any one of the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/category">licenses approved by the Open Source
Initiative</a></p><p>Code that you write is <strong>your</strong> code, with which you can do what you
will; true. However, if you&#x2019;re unwilling to license code you write for
an Free/Open Source course with a Free/Open Source license, you may be
in the wrong course.</p><p>Similarly, the essence of this course entails your doing significant
collaborative work in public, the results of which will remain public.
If you do not wish to make your work public in this way, please contact
the instructor during the first week of class to make other
arrangements.</p></div><div class="step step-level-1" step="5" data-rotate-x="0" data-rotate-y="0" data-rotate-z="0" data-scale="1" data-x="8000" data-y="0" data-z="0"><blockquote><p>## Schedule</p></blockquote><p>Please see this living <a href="schedule.org">schedule</a> which should be

their investigations, progress, success, and pitfalls. This blog can be
hosted anywhere, but must be added to the course <a href="/checkblogs">participant
page</a> (there are instructions on how to do this in
<a href="/hw/firstflight">*Homework - First Flight*</a>). All blog posts are
syndicated to the blog aggregator <a href="https://people.rit.edu/djaigm/planet/hfoss/">HFOSS
Planet</a>.</p><blockquote><p>You must make at least one blog post per week to receive full
credit. This is in addition to any assignments that are posted to
your blog for that week. You must participate regularly in the
course&#x2019;s IRC channel: asking and answering questions. Contributions
to the course curriculum, syllabus, and rubric are factored in here
as well.</p></blockquote><p>Blogging is good for you and good for the <a href="http://xkcd.com/979/">FLOSS community at
large</a>.</p><h1 id="team-projects">Team Projects</h1><p>There are two team projects in the course: A community architecture
project and a final project.</p><h1 id="lightning-talks-extra-credit">Lightning Talks - Extra Credit</h1><p>Every Friday for the first portion of class, any student has the

will be allowed during a given class. Talks will be chosen from among
those offered by students on a <tt>FIFO</tt> basis.</p><h1 id="bug-fix-extra-credit">Bug Fix - Extra Credit</h1><p>You can earn extra credit by successfully fixing a bug in a FOSS
project.</p><p>You will receive +10 extra credit points towards your final grade for
every pull request accepted by an independently-maintained project
against a pre-existing bug (eg, fixing new bugs you found, or even
generated don't count!).</p><p>Send an <a href="email:deejoe@mail.rit.edu">email to the instructor</a> with
sufficient detail to confirm your bug fix was accepted.</p><h1 id="accomodations">Accomodations</h1><p>RIT is committed to providing reasonable accommodations to students with
