What is a lightning talk?

  • A description of some product or technology
  • "Lightning", cause it's fast
  • "talk" because it's a presentation
  • Convention staple; related to the 'elevator pitch' but less creepy.

How will we use lightning talks?

  • Class credit
  • You need to do at least 1
  • 5 minutes or less - but not much less
  • Topic should be a open source technology or project
  • Schedule it ahead of time
  • Signup list is on class syllabus

How will YOU do lightning talks?

  • It's called lightning for a reason!
  • Don't drag out the time, but make it feel comprehensive
  • For the 5 minutes this runs, you are the expert
  • Pick something you find interesting
  • Present with slides, even if it's only a few

How will YOU do lightning talks, part 2?

  • Pictures are great
  • Don't use cliched images
  • Or anything that would show on Imgur/Reddit
  • [rageface]

A digression on imagery

How will I grade lightning talks?

  • I need to be educated on the topic
  • Quality over quantity
  • I need to be interested/excited about the topic
  • Let your enthusiasm show
  • You can be enthusastic about things that don't work well
  • You can be enthusastic about things that are strange

Example time!
