What is a lightning talk?
-------------------------


- A description of some product or technology
- "Lightning", cause it's fast
- "talk" because it's a presentation
- Convention staple; related to the 'elevator pitch' but less creepy.

How will we use lightning talks?
--------------------------------


- Class credit
- You need to do at least 1
- 5 minutes or less - but not much less
- Topic should be a open source technology or project


----

How will YOU do lightning talks?
--------------------------------


- It's called lightning for a reason!
- Don't drag out the time, but make it feel comprehensive
- For the 5 minutes this runs, you are the expert
- Pick something you find interesting
- Present with slides, even if it's only a few

----

How will YOU do lightning talks, part 2?
----------------------------------------


- Pictures are great
- Don't use cliched images
- Or anything that would show on Imgur/Reddit
- [rageface]

----

How will I grade lightning talks?
---------------------------------


- I need to be educated on the topic
- Quality over quantity
- I need to be interested/excited about the topic
- Let your enthusiasm show
- You can be enthusastic about things that don't work well
- You can be enthusastic about things that are strange
